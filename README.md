# Algorithms-Sequential-Parallel-Distributed

This repository would contain every algorithm of that AMAZING book https://amzn.to/2OjKobm. I have read about 75% of it before, but just skimming and every chapter I would solve three or four problems. What I am going to do now is implementing every single algorithm in the book; solved example, exercises, or even just hinted about it in the book.
</br>
Implementation for algorithms in C++, Java and Python would be provided for every problem and as for Other stuff section, it would consist of just little bit of <b>chat</b> about the problem.
</br>
If I copied someone's solution for a problem, I would acknowledge that in the code itself; comment.
