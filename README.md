# Algorithms-Sequential-Parallel-Distributed

**I'm in a middle of a hard semester now, but I didn't abandon the project**

This repository is meant to be a very **comprehensive** solution manual/notes/implementations for https://amzn.to/2OjKobm. My intention is to implement all the algorithms explained in the book or even have been hinted at.</br>
The motivation behind that, because while I was studying from that book and after a bit of searching for ambigious stuff in it, I couldn't find any solutions or anything like CLRS or skiena books solutions and articles floating the internet, despite being much better and focused in my opinion.</br>

----

The description is very much explaining how I will do things here, but there are some stuff to be taken in consideration, if you will use any of that code.</br></br> If I going to do something cool in any algorithm, see the `python`, `c++`, `java`, or `bash` implementations, the other languages implementations are just me googling how to write for loops and decalre variables in these languages, `bash` is like that also but I have written multiple not-so-trivial stuff with it before. I usually read each chapter multiple times, so If you find something missing, check later and hopefully you will find it.</br></br>

Clicking on the algorithm link in the table below, would take you to a certain language implementation, which in my opinion is most commented and educational than the rest of implementation for the same algorithm, maybe I left cool fact or did something cool in the implementation.</br></br></br>

</br>For every data structure there would be a corresponding file for that in the data structure directory, in which the data structure, and all the mentioned utilities for the data structures are implemented with anything cool, but not *very* cool, I find.</br>
