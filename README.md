# Algorithms-Sequential-Parallel-Distributed

This repository would contain every algorithm of that AMAZING book https://amzn.to/2OjKobm. I have read about 75% of it before, but just skimming and every chapter I would solve three or four problems. What I am going to do now is implementing every single algorithm in the book; solved example, exercises, or even just hinted about it in the book.
</br>
Implementation for algorithms in multiple language <b>based on my mood</b> would be provided for every problem and as for Other stuff section, it would consist of just little bit of <b>chat</b> about the problem.
</br>
If I copied someone's solution for a problem, I would acknowledge that in the code itself.
</br>
this repo is just for myself to get better at coding so sometimes you will find me using different libraries or test suites or whatever. I'm starting this repo and I "think" that i know python,old c++,bash,java, and a bit of javascript, but I'm planning to learn while coding other languages. You may notice that I get a bit better "hopfully" as you go through examples and get a bit cleaner
