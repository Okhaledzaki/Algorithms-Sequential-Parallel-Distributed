# Algorithms-Sequential-Parallel-Distributed

This repository would contain every algorithm of that AMAZING book https://amzn.to/2OjKobm. I have read about 75% of it before, but just skimming and every chapter I would solve three or four problems. What I am going to do now is implementing every single algorithm in the book; solved example, exercises, or even just hinted about it in the book.
</br>
Implementation for algorithms in multiple language <b>based on my mood</b> would be provided for every problem and as for Other stuff section, it would consist of just little bit of <b>chat</b> about the problem.</br></br>
This repo is just for myself to get better at coding so sometimes you will find me using different libraries or test suites or weird languages or whatever. I'm starting this repo and I "think" that i know a bit python,some c++,bash,java, a bit of javascript, and very little Go. Anyways I'm planning to learn more, just to make myself as much flexible as possible and hopefully to grow and have strong opinions about languages and debate with people on reddit and quora about how terrible java is :D. You may notice that I get a bit better "hopfully" as you go through examples and get a bit cleaner. I added the date column for self-loathing purposes.
</br></br>
<b>Note</b>: I used pytest for testing python, catch2 for testing c++, and as for bash scripts I intend to use shunit2
