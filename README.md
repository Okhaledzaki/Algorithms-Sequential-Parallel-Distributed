# Algorithms-Sequential-Parallel-Distributed

This repository would contain every algorithm of that AMAZING book https://amzn.to/2OjKobm. I have read about 75% of it before, but just skimming and every chapter and solve three of four problems. What I am going to do now is implementing every single algorithm in the book; solved example, exercises, or even just hinted about it in the book.
